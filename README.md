## 🔬 About Us

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the **CAMIs Mobility Lab** at the University of Georgia. 

We are a research group dedicated to advancing the fields of **Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs)**, **Robotics**, and **Cyber-Physical Systems**. Our research bridges the gap between theoretical algorithms and real-world applications, focusing on perception, planning, and control in complex environments.
